				h3 Alert System Gatherer
				p Me and three others created this project at EWU for our University Culminating Project. The purpose of this project is to provide a a single web app that provides information and push notifications for local alerts in the Spokane area. Alerts include WSDOT traffic alerts such as road closures, traffic incidents, road conditions, and severe weather warnings through NWS. The future goal of the project is too include other alert services like fires, crime, and school closures.

				h4 Project Structure
				
				p The project structure is broken up into two parts, the CronUpdater, and the WebApp.
					ul
						li
							| The function of the CronUpdater is to check at regular intervals whether or not the WSDOT or NWS has new alerts, update the current alerts, and store this information on the database. The user never see's any part of the CronUpdater.
						li
							| The WebApp handles all user interactions like one might see in any other website.
