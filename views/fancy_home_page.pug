          .sub-font
            p Me and three others created this project at EWU for our University Culminating Project. The purpose of this project is to provide a a single web app that provides information and push notifications for local alerts in the Spokane area. Alerts include WSDOT traffic alerts such as road closures, traffic incidents, road conditions, and severe weather warnings through NWS. The future goal of the project is too include other alert services like fires, crime, and school closures.
